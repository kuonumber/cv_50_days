## pre-build version vs self-build version
The difference is if you build from source, then you can enable or disable some functionalities, for example, you can build OpenCV with opencv_contrib module, Or you can build OpenCV with Deep-Learning-Inference-Engine-backend, Or CUDA, Or Qt, Or with GStreamer, Or with tesseract-ocr and many other configurations which you can change or enable/disable. But if you do not need the extra functionality, then you can directly install the pre-built library and use it.
